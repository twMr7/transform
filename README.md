transform
================
A simple console tool to test the geometric/spatial transformations offered by [geometry module](http://eigen.tuxfamily.org/dox/group__TutorialGeometry.html) of Eigen.

Prerequisites
-------------
- ***[Poco C++ libraries](https://github.com/pocoproject/poco)*** version 1.7.8
- ***[Eigen](http://eigen.tuxfamily.org)*** version 3.3.3

The library dependencies rely on the integration environment of [*vcpkg*](https://github.com/Microsoft/vcpkg) ports for MSVC. Use of *vcpkg* is recommended for a quick start. Otherwise, it is necessary to modify the project settings for your own development environment.
